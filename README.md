- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ClarissaVinciguerra, a Swift developer with a drive to develop my skills and build things! As my learning progresses, I hope to contribute to more projects that help improve society in some way, and provide me the opportunity to work on a collaborative team. If you know of any opportunities like this, you can reach me at humbleswiftdev@yahoo.com.
